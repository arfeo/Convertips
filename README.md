# Convertips

Text conversion utility for Mac OS 7-9.

I believe this is the source code of [Convertips Pro](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/convertips-pro), a text converter for Win/DOS/Mac/Unix files made in 1999, which was kinda Pro version of Convertips 1.0 (CLI) and Covertips 1.1 (GUI), both dated back to 1997. But I am not pretty sure.

I have no idea how to build this stuff due to the lack of project resources.
